### Overview of the repository

This repository contains some random, fun side projects in Python / Jupyter notebooks. It includes the following files:

- wine_tasting_scoring: Notebook for conducting a wine tasting and selecting the winning wines based on the votes of the people involved. Information about each wine is entered and each user inputs scores as the tasting progresses. When all wines have been tasted, the winners are selected based on all scores.
