# small-side-projects

### Overview of the repository

This repository contains some random, fun side projects done in Python / Jupyter notebooks. It includes the following files:

- **wine_tasting_scoring.ipynb**: Notebook for conducting a wine tasting and selecting the winning wines based on the votes of the people involved. Information about each wine is entered and each user inputs scores as the tasting progresses. When all wines have been tasted, the winners are selected based on all scores.  

- **random_friend_generator.ipynb**: Small script for generating random pairs within a team or group of friends, e.g. if you want to boost the team spirit by selecting random "secret friends" each week. Handles pairs that have already ocurred and uneven number of people.

- **grocery_list_generator**: Randomly selects dishes to cook from a pre-populated lists and creates shopping lists with all required ingredients. These can be organized based on how your local store is set up.
